    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The country of Madagascar was one of the last places to be settled on by humans.
      During the 17th and 18th century it was utilized as a pirate stronghold.
      Later on it became a center for slave trading.
      </p>

    <p>
      The Marina Kingdom dominated the country from the 16thto 19th century.
      They were conquered by the French in 1896, but regained their freedom in the year 1960.
    </p>

    <p>
     From 1992-93 seventeen years of single-party rule ended. Madagascar's Leader in the
     70s and 80s, Didier RATSIRAKA, returned to his role. In the 2001 presidential race RATSIRAKA
     lost his title to Marc RAVALOMANANA. He was reelected in 2006, but for his third
     term in 2009 he turned the power over to the military before power was then given to the mayor
   of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a long mediation process, led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held a UN-supported
     presidential elections in 2013.This led to the election of minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA.
     In January of 2019,RAJOELINA was declared ruler after beating RAVALOMANANA in a run-off election.

            Hello and welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Jabria Roscoe
            and I'm an aspiring writer and journalist with a passion for helping

            I'm a recent graduate from the University of Miami (UM)
            where I recieved a Bachelor's Degree in Journalism.

            During my time at UM I published articles for The Miami
            Hurricane, School of Communication, and the award-winning student run
            magazine, Distraction.

            I am currently seeking full time employment in the marketing or
            journalism field. My goal is to work for a company that will allow
            me to make a positive contribution to my community.

            <p>
            In addition, I would like to continue to develop my writing and
            interpersonal skills through my work as a professional in the
            communications field.
